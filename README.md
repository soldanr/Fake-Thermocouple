A DIY Thermocouple Test Circuit !
The circuit is a voltage divider  with a 150Kohm resistor and a 1Kohm precision potentiomenter (trim pot) powered by a 9 Volt Battery. To add a little character to the board we added some capacitors, an On-Off switch, an LED, a 5V voltage regulator  and the famous LM 324 Op-Amp acting like a Buffer Amplifier.
